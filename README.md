# Analysis of the semantic categorization technique of analogous labels using the
Deep Learning Technique

The research paper was published at an international conference. 
This paper introduces the idea model of usual language to resolve elevated modes
of presenting and semantic opening in conventional 3-dimensional space models
and methods.
Deep learning was used to analyse and select methods and parameters needed for
training, while Huffman tree is proposed to resolve characteristic removal
replicas of natural language text.
